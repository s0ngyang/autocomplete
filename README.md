# Autocomplete

Beep FE SWE Intern Take Home

**Changes to props**

- onInputChange was removed. It is implemented in the Autocorrect component as it captures many internal states within the component, given my implementation.

**UI refinements that I did not implement**

- Options should close after clicking for single mode
- Unhover when using arrow keys to navigate
- Escape should blur input on top of closing options
